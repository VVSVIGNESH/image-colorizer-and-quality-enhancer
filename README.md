# image-colorizer-and-quality-enhancer
 Developed an AI-powered image processing tool that uses a Deep learning colorization model  (Caffe) with 86% accuracy to restore colors in black-and-white images. Implemented a Wiener filter-based deblurring algorithm with Fourier transforms to enhance image  clarity and used PyTesseract and OCR to extract text from image.
